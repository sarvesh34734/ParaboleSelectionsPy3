The solution is based on Natural Language Processing.
First, tagging is done using python module NLTK and use semi-supervised algorithm.

Algo:

-> Start with seed set R of tuples.
-> Generate set of patterns from known relations and find support and confidence.
-> Generate new set of tuples matching pattern and find support and confidence. Remove tuples which has confidance < threashold.
-> Repeat above steps until all the matching patterns are found.
